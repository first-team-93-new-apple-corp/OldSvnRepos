String Parsing Exercise
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are provided with a StudentDatabase.csv file. This file contains information
about various students at Acme High School, including names, GPAs, Student IDs, 
Expected Graduation Dates, and Membership in FIRST.

For Problem 1, your goal is to read in the CSV file and print out the contents to
the console.

When the File fails to compile due to "Throwing a FileNotFoundException", you need to:
Hover over the red line complaining about the File,
Select the quick fix for "Add throws declaration",
Done!

Hint:
You should look at the Javadocs for the File and Scanner classes:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After completing Problem 1, your next goal is to read in the CSV file and print to
the console the information for students who are members of FIRST. In other words, you
want to filter out the students who are not on the FIRST team.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your next goal is to read in the CSV file and print to the console just the names
and Student IDs of the students who are members of FIRST.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, if you have completed problems 1 through 3, you should have a firm
grasp of how to read data from a CSV file and parse it. Your next goal (if you haven't
already done this during the previous problems) is to create a Student class
to hold the information from each row in the CSV file. Then when you read in the CSV
file, you should store the student information as a list (or array) of Student objects.
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your next goal is to sort your list (or array) of students alphabetically by name, and print
to the console the names and student IDs of the FIRST students in alphabetical order.

Hint:
You may want to look at the "sort" method in the List class and the Comparable interface:
