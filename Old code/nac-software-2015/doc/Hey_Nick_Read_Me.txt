Test

Nick, I do not know what time I will make it in today...if at all.
Last night, as you will be able to see in the svn log is codereview stuff, I believe after we resolve a few issues and questions it will be okay to use at Duluth.  I would like to add more, but that may not be possible before Wednesday.
Today the number one priotry for me is to get the repo on the apple, there may be an issue, since a long time ago, rev. 29ish I may have upload the installers, large files, misunderstanding your directions.  This issue will only cause time loss when doing a check out
Prority List
	1) Repo on Apple 
	2) Check that software is updated on all of the computers and that they are read to go - Ask Sam K. about the software list, I am not sure if it was shared with you on google drive
	3) Review Codereview comments
	4) Add to Codereview comments
	5) Develope camera software further
	6) Test software on the second robot
This list should be what takes us up to Duluth
