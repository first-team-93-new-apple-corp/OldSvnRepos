This includes negative whole numbers (-200, -42, -1), positive whole numbers (69, 420, 1337) and 0.
This type of variable has a limit: It can only go up to (2^31 - 1) or down to (-2^31 + 1), which is 2147483647 to -2147483647.

double:
This type of variable can be set to decimals, as it is a type of floating point number.
"Floating point number" kind of means "floating decimal point number".
This can be set to numbers such as 3.14, 1.0, and 0.333333333.
WARNING! Due to the computer calculating in binary, there are inaccuracies that may occur. This is similar to how we can't divide 10 by 3 accurately.
Doubles also have a limit to how large they can be.
