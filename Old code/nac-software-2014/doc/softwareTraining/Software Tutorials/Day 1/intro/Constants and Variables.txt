A constant is a number that cannot change.
1 will always be equal to 1, 2 will always be equal to 2, and 0 will always be equal to 0.
Constants don't necessarily have to be numbers.
They can be booleans, as true will always equal true, and false will always equal false.
Any number that you can type is a constant.
You can't set 1 to the value of 2. That just doesn't work.

Variables are things that can change.
For example, I can make a integer variable called "ConorToolFactor" and set it to 1.
That number is a variable, so I can change the value that variable is set to.
Therefore, I can set it to 2 afterwards without causing problems.
However, I can only set variables to things that they allow.
For example, an integer and a boolean are two different types.
I can't set ConorToolFactor to true, as it is an integer.
If I were to make a boolean "ColbyAwesomeFactor" and set it to true, I could not later set it to 1, as that is a different type.
