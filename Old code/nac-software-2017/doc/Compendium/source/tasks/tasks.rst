Common Tasks
============

These are some tasks that software members commonly must do, so it is good to know how to do these tasks.

Changing pins in RobotMap is fairly self explanatory, since you just change the numbers and make sure nothing conflicts, so it is not included in this guide (I also ran out of time).

There is already `a guide in WPILib's screenstepslive documentation on using SmartDashboard <https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/26401>`_, so it is also not included in this guide.
