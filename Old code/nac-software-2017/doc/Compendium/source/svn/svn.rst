Using SVN
=========

SVN is the version control software that we use. It allows multiple people to work on the same project by merging their changes, and also allows us to revert any unwanted changes to the code if it introduced a bug.

**Note:** I hope Nick or someone can add tutorials for using branch/tag, merge, and switch. I'm ashamed to admit this, but I've never actually used it in SVN. I've actually just made a new project in branches each time and then hand-merged into trunk...
