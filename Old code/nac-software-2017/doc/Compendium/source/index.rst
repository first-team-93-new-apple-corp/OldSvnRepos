Welcome to Evans Chen's Software Guide!
=======================================

This is Evans Chenâ€™s compendium of software knowledge accumulated while he was on the team. Hopefully, this short collection of information can serve software for future generations.

This guide is designed to build on `WPILib's screenstepslive documentation <https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809>`_.

For example, the screenstepslive documentation has many examples using the Iterative Robot design, but our team uses the Command-based Robot design, since it scales well for larger projects. Additionally, the screenstepslive documentation pushes the RobotDrive class, which is much less flexible than implementing your own drive command.

However, if an adequate explanation is already provided in the screenstepslive documentation, I will simply provide a link to it.

Also, don't forget that the `WPILibJ Javadoc <http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/>`_ is also a useful resource.
