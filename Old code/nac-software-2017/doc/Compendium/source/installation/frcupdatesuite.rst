National Instruments FRC Update Suite
=====================================

All software laptops will need the NI FRC Update Suite, since it contains Driver Station and other tools necessary to run the robot.

Instructions for installing can be found on screenstepslive, usually on a page titled “Installing the FRC 20XX Update Suite” where XX is school year.

Installation may also require creating a National Instruments account (which a student email can be used for) and serial number (which should be received by kickoff).
