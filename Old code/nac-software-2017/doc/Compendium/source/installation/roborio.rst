Make sure the RoboRIO works
 - Try accessing the RoboRIO dashboard.
 - Try deploying and running code via USB.
 - Read the error message and follow its instructions.
 - Note that different versions of the NIUpdateSuite may be incompatible, so make sure that the version on the computer is the same version as imaged onto the RoboRIO.
 - If all else fails, re-image and try again.

For more information on deploying and running, see `Building and downloading a robot project to the roboRIO <https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/242586-building-and-downloading-a-robot-project-to-the-roborio>`_.
