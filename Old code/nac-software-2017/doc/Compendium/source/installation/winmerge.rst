========

All software laptops should have WinMerge, since sometimes TortoiseMerge (which comes with TortoiseSVN) just doesn’t do the trick, especially when manually merging code.

It makes Code Arch’s job a lot easier.

`Download and install the latest version of WinMerge. <http://winmerge.org/?lang=en>`_
