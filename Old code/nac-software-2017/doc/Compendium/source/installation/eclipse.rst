Java, Eclipse, and the FRC Plugins
==================================

All software laptops will need these.

`Instructions for installing Java, Eclipse, and the FRC Plugins <https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/599679-installing-eclipse-c-java/>`_

Note that it may not be possible to install eclipse on school wifi.

Also note that each time you create a new workspace, you will need to tell Eclipse the location of the JDK again.

Furthermore, if all installation instructions were followed, but imports and the JDK are still not resolved, try creating a new, empty Robot Project, and then try restarting Eclipse.
