Installation
============

It is impossible to create and use FRC software without installing it beforehand. Many of the most confusing problems can be solved simply by correctly re-installing incorrectly installed or corrupted software.
The Software Corps uses a wide variety of software tools, some more important than others, to help write code and control the robot. An overview of the software’s purpose and installation will be covered for each tool that is used.
Note that, before competitions, installers for all of these pieces of software must be backed up on The Apple USB drive, both for our use and so that we may help other teams.

Also note that, in addition to these software tools, newly obtained laptops will require drivers to be installed also. Simply look up the drivers for the make and model of the laptop, and download the drivers from the official manufacturer site. For example, for HP Elitebooks, one would download the drivers from the HP website.

I’m not going to reinvent the wheel here.
I’m often just going to provide links to the very helpful screenstepslive website, or download links.
I assume you’re smart enough to click the big download button and install software on your own.
