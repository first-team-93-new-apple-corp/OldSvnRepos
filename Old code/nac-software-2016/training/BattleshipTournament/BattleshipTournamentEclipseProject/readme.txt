To get started, Import the project into Eclipse by using "Import existing Java project."

There are two test player classes, TestGamePlayer.java and TestGamePlayer2.java.  This allows you to easily modify them and play the two classes against eachother.

Eventually, you will want to copy and paste a TestGamePlayer class into your own class, with a name like NickLutherGamePlayer instead.  Then develop this class to be the best game player you can make it.  Your final submission is a single .java file containing this class.

The main methods (functions) you'll want to edit in the GamePlayer class are placeShips() and fireNow().  Change placeShips() to place your ships somewhere where your opponent won't be looking for them.  A random placement may be fine.  Change fireNow() to intelligently shoot at your opponents ships.  Get feedback from which shots hit and missed, and which types of ships you've sunk.  You can even get feedback from the name of your opponent as you play multiple times in a tournament.

The existing command line interface will run one match and report a winner as well as the number of shots.
